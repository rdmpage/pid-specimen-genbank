# Introduction 

A page to demonstrate various identifiers and linkages. 

Natural history collections held in museums preserve and archive various types of biological and geological specimens that provide a physical record of the biodiversity in the natural world. Together, these specimens and associated data (such as publications and molecular sequence data) represent an unparalleled resource to study the world's biodiversity. However, the current ecosystem of specimens and collection management globally is highly fragmented with discipline-specific data and metadata standards and institutional repositories. A consistent and sustainable approach to linking these physical specimens with other identifiable entities is then crucial for findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reproducibility i.e., achieving data ‘FAIRness’. 

Within the [DiSSCo](https://dissco.eu) project, we are proposing the idea of [Digital Specimens](https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.3.37033) that act as representations of physical specimens. We are envisioning a ‘unified knowledge graph’ where Digital Specimens sit as nodes in an interconnected graph of connections between specimens, and connections from specimens to third-party sources of data/information related to those specimens. 


# Background information 

* Persistent Identfiers (PID) 

"A persistent identifier (PI or PID) is a long-lasting reference to a document, file, web page, or other object. The term "persistent identifier" is usually used in the context of digital objects that are accessible over the Internet"

* Digital Object 
https://www.dona.net/sites/default/files/2018-11/DOIPv2Spec_1.pdf

"A digital object (DO) is a sequence of bits, or a set of sequences of bits, incorporating a work or portion of a work or other information in which a party has rights or interests, or in which there is value, each of the sequences being structured in a way that is interpretable by one or more computational facilities. Each DO has, as an essential element,
an associated unique persistent identifier, known as digital object identifier (referred to informally as a handle)."

* Physical and Digital Specimen ID 

This is a physical specimen id (often times maintained in the collection management system by the collection holding institute) : B100586893. The URL associated with this physical specimen: http://herbarium.bgbm.org/object/B100586893

This is a Digital Specimen ID (20.5000.1025/c4942d87a9f89d8929c1 which is a handle): http://hdl.handle.net/20.5000.1025/c4942d87a9f89d8929c1

And links to the physical specimen id

## Search in the ENA database 

String search "RMNH*". We only grab a few fields and the first 5 records in tsv format. 
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "result=sequence_release&query=specimen_voucher%3D%22RMNH*%22&fields=specimen_voucher%2Caccession%2Cscientific_name%2Ctax_id&limit=5&format=tsv" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/search"

```
Output in tsv format:

How can I verify that these records are indeed currently housed in the Naturalis Biodiversity Center formerly Rijksmuseum van der Natuurlijke Historie?

After some manual investigation (via gbif record https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/2434390604) we find this: 

https://bioportal.naturalis.nl/specimen/RMNH.CRUS.D.38033

Looks like the ENA record is missing the full physical specimen id. How can we do this in a more efficient way? 

# Digital Specimen 

Only if we had a digital object connecting all these links:
